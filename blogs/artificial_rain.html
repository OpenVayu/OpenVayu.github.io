Air Pollution has been one of the biggest offenders when it comes to Air Quality in Delhi. With reported deaths surpassing 30,000 [Source: HT (<a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi/air-pollution-kills-30k-in-delhi-every-year/story-8V6MbjDh6JC2PifATbSutO.html" target="_blank">deaths surpassing 30,000</a>)] in a year, Air Pollution can no longer be ignored. Delhi government’s recent <b>Odd-Even scheme</b> was an initiative to curb the rampant pollution. While a great initiative, it failed to have any significant impact on the pollution. The consistently degrading air quality has brought Delhi in a position akin to its Chinese counterpart, Beijing. Beijing has been going through a huge crisis regarding this issue. In fact, Los Angeles and London have been struggling to cope with air pollution too. This is clearly not a third world problem.<p>
At the Climate talks in Paris last month, <b>PM Modi</b> deftly pointed out that a developing country such as India couldn’t be put to blame. Not as much as developed countries anyway. While mostly true, India can no longer hide behind this poor-country-victim cloak.<p>
Delhi is the <b>most polluted city</b> in the world. Other Indian cities are following suit. This, in itself, should terrify us out of our wits. But, it doesn’t and therein lies the problem.<p>
So, what could we possibly do to end this? Where do we even start?<p>
One possible solution is <b>Artificial Rain</b>. This is not a new method to tackle air pollution. This has been tested over the years by countries such as China, US, Australia and many countries in Europe. Back home in India, Cloud seeding operations have been conducted in Tamil Nadu by the state government in 1980’s and 1990’s to combat drought. Karnataka government did something similar in 2003-04.<p>
So what is Artificial Rain, exactly?<p>
Artificial Rain is the act of attempting to <i>artificially induce</i> or <i>increase precipitation</i>. This is done using airplanes or rockets, sowing clouds with catalysts such as dry ice, silver iodide and salt powder. It has many applications including increase in precipitation, increase in reservoir irrigation water and to help in growth of water levels for power generation. But, it is often used as a means to reduce Air pollution in a particular area.
China has used Artificial Rain as a means to reduce smog in cities like Beijing, Lanzhou, Chengdu and Wuhan. The Chinese government has invested heavily in this technology: to the amount of 1.7 trillion Yuan for 2 years. The weather manipulation technique has been the major combatant when it comes to Air pollution in China. This technique has also been employed in Maharashtra, albeit unsuccessfully. The failure was a product of the lack of proper equipment. Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have done it successfully. These attempts were to tackle drought, however.<p>
Artificial rain is not without its controversies, though. The director of the environmental ministry’s official think tank perceived artificial rainfall as only a palliative. <i?“When the smog is severe, artificial rainfall is like emergency treatment for a critically ill patient,”</i> said Xia Guang. <i>“It may temporarily alleviate air pollution. But if we want to be rid of smog, there are many aspects to aim our efforts at,”</i> Xia was quoted as saying by Xinhua.
In essence, artificial rain will work as a painkiller but not as a proper cure. But, this painkiller has showed impressive results and has proved to be quite effective over the long run, so much so that the Chinese have been said to have used artificial rainfall to unlock nearly 490 billion tonnes of precipitation nationwide, between 2002 and 2012.<p>
There is not much happening in Delhi, when it comes to the worsening air pollution. Odd-even isn’t enough but, an effective plan of attack can be formed by bringing Artificial rain in the loop.      </div>
