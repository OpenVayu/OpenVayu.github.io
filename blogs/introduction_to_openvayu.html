        <p>
OpenVayu is an initiative to bring together people from all across the board with a singular passion for making a change. We aim to <a href="http://airquality.hindustantimes.com/" target="_blank">research air quality</a> and climate change and analyze how it affects our lifestyle and our planet, at large. Our vision is to mobilize thinkers and doers and to empower them for the betterment of our world.</p>
<p>
Knowledge, as they say, is power. We completely agree. That’s why OpenVayu is not obligated by any financial restraints which will allow us to continue our endeavor unperturbed. We want to see tangible results that make our existence at least a little better which is why our research will be open-source so that you, the doer, can guide our vision to its fruition.
</p>






<h2>Why and How?</h2>

      <p>OpenVayu was formed on the foundation of change. We strongly believe in keeping the incumbents in check and giving you, the people, the power of insight. We also understand that there is a chasm between wishful thinking and taking responsibility- we prefer the latter. Air quality has been the cause of major concern for many metropolitan cities including Los Angeles, Beijing, and New Delhi. Climate change isn’t making things any easier. Our planet needs us to come together and act. OpenVayu is our small contribution to this noble cause. </p><p>
A <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B56WcSTeFY9WTXppOUlwcklaclE">previous research</a> we were working on led to the idea that is OpenVayu. Our work will speak for itself and while the results are uncertain, we would like to think that we can pull it off. After all, hope is better than hapless misery.
</p>


<h2>Projects in the pipeline</h2>
<p>
We are currently working on VAYU, a technology that will provide people real-time information about pollution and its sources in their area. This project is an ambitious one and will be our primary focus. However, we will continue to work on different research projects and post their results on the website.
</p>


<h2>Future</h2>
      <p>
We intend to expand our operations to a much larger scale. Our projects will get more ambitious with time and our commitment stronger. We need your support. Are you ready to make a difference?
