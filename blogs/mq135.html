Sensors are nowadays used in everyday objects and have become a part of the everyday smart life. Applications range from machinery, airplanes, aerospace, cars, medicine, robotics etc. Sensor is an object which detects events and changes in its environment. Sensors can be classified as transducers as they quantify changes in their environment through various types of output, typically electrical or optical signals. The earlier notion of using sensors to measure the basic characteristics of an object has now extended to advance characteristics by inclusion of latest technologies like image, audio, video and RF signals.</p>
<p>
Semiconductor sensors detect gases by a chemical reaction that takes place when the gas comes in direct contact with the sensor. The change in resistance is used to calculate the gas concentration. MQ135 is a stable semiconductor gas sensor which has good sensitivity to harmful gases in wide range. <a href="https://www.olimex.com/Products/Components/Sensors/SNS-MQ135/resources/SNS-MQ135.pdf" target="_blank">Datasheet of MQ135</a> is a poor indicator of its characteristics and functioning. A wide detection scope makes further analysis even difficult. <a href="http://davidegironi.blogspot.in/2014/01/cheap-co2-meter-using-mq135-sensor-with.html" target="_blank">Davide Gironi</a> suggested mathematical formulation of sensitivity characteristics to find ppm values of different gases. The formulations thus used did not incorporate the effect of physical temperature and humidity and are not performing well under diverse conditions. In this study, the impact of the physical parameters, temperature and humidity, is considered on ppm values of CO2 gas as detected by the MQ135 sensor. This influence of temperature and humidity is further incorporated in the mathematical calibrationusing multiple regression analysis and also in the proposed algorithm to find ppm value of a gas. </p>


<h2>Overview</h2>

      <p><b><a href="http://www.micropik.com/PDF/dht11.pdf" target="_blank">Digital temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11)</a></b> is a composite sensor that gives a calibrated digital signal output of the temperature and humidity. It houses the dedicated digital modules collection technology and the temperature and humidity sensing technology, to ensure that the product has high reliability and excellent long-term stability.</p><p> 
<b>MQ135 Semiconductor Sensor</b> is a stable, low cost electrochemical gas sensor suitable for detecting a wide range of VOCs and gases. It is extremely sensitive to Ammonia, Sulphide and Benzene, also sensitive to smoke and other harmful gases. The MQ series of gas sensors use a small heater inside with an electro-chemical sensor and are usually used indoors at room temperature. Their calibration preferably requires a known concentration of the measured gas. Absence of any electronic components allow usage of both AC and DC voltages </p>

<h2>Limitations of the MQ135 Sensor</h2>
<p>
The MQ135 gas sensor detects a number of gases like ammonia, CO2, SO2 etc. collectively but is unable to identify the individual gas concentration in a polluted environment. The sensor also uses an inbuilt heater to warm up air near thesensitive part for oxidation or reduction to take place.  It has been advised not to use this with a small battery source as it will quickly drain your battery. Sensor requires 24-48 hours of warm up time to start emitting stable readings of gas concentration.

<p>Moreover the datasheet provided with the sensor does not provideclear information about the characteristics of sensor. The graph indicating the sensitivity characteristics of the sensor does not provide accurate readings for individual gases. Datasheet does not tell us much for detecting concentration scope for CO2 gas, as the graph is onlyprovided from 0.1 to 100ppm. Datasheet provides little information about the temperature and humidity dependence of the output resistance of the sensor.</p>

<h2>Gironi's Formulation</h2>
<p>DavideGironi, a software engineer from "Universita degli Studi", Milano worked on various aspects of the MQ135 Gas Sensor. He analysed the sensitivity characteristics of the MQ-135 from the poorly documented datasheet of this sensor. He used the senstivity characteristic graph to convert the output of sensor to the related ppm characteristics for the gas under test. After studying the sensitivity graph of MQ135, Gironi felt that the resistance ratio of the sensor (RS/RO) and the gas concentration (ppm) are related as a power function. Using power regression, he obtained the scaling factor (a), and the exponential factor (b), for the gas. He used both these parameters to calculate the corresponding concentration. He also proposed that the calibration of RS can be done in clean air once stable readings are being received from the sensor. The concentration scope of a particular gas was identified using datasheet leading to the computation of the limit for RS/RO. Finally, a Matlab script was used for power regression and polynomial curve fitting. Raw values were converted to calculated resistance and an arbitrary value of RO, was used in the mathematical formulation of the microcontroller. The RO calibration is very important because every MQ135 sensor is different from the other and they require individual calibration.</p>
<h2>Proposed System</h2>
      <p>
The proposed system consists of the MQ135 sensor, Microcontroller Development Board (Arduino UNO), DHT-11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor and Software support with display. The block diagram of overall system is given indicating the steps design to convert analog signals from MQ135 sensor and DHT11 to their corresponding values in PPM and temperature and humidity. Design includes development of the code for Arduino microcontroller and a MATLAB script for plotting Serial data from Arduino directly to MATLAB. Excel is used to produce the real time graph plotting of the gas concentration detected for the analysis and calibration purpose.
