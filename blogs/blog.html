              <h2>Influence of Temperature and Humidity on the Output Resistance Ratio of the MQ-135 Sensor</h2>
              <p>Limited usage of MQ135 in the past years is attributed to a very poor quality datasheet which caused many researchers to conclude the sensitivity characteristic graph to be a power function. Further power regression is used to find appropriate scaling and exponential factors.

              <h2>Artificial Rain: A solution to Air pollution?</h2>
              <p>Air Pollution has been one of the biggest offenders when it comes to Air Quality in Delhi. With reported deaths surpassing 30,000 in a year, Air Pollution can no longer be ignored. Beijing has been going through a huge crisis regarding this issue. In fact, Los Angeles and London have been struggling to cope with air pollution too. This is clearly not a third world problem.
